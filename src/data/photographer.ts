  heroIntroduction: 'Passionate about defending organizations from cyber threats through proactive monitoring, threat detection, and incident response.',
  biography: `I'm an aspiring SOC Analyst with a strong foundation in network security, threat detection, and incident response. Currently pursuing my CompTIA Security+ certification while actively building hands-on experience through home labs and platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox.

My journey into cybersecurity began with a fascination for understanding how systems work—and how they can be protected. I've developed skills in SIEM tools, log analysis, and malware detection through dedicated self-study and practical projects. I'm particularly interested in threat hunting and security automation.

I bring a methodical approach to problem-solving and a genuine enthusiasm for continuous learning. I'm eager to contribute to a security team where I can apply my skills while growing as a security professional.`,
  approach: `My approach to cybersecurity is rooted in three core principles: continuous learning, attention to detail, and systematic thinking. I believe effective security requires understanding both the technical and human elements of threats.

I stay current with the latest threat intelligence, practice regularly in lab environments, and document my findings thoroughly. Whether analyzing logs, investigating alerts, or researching new attack vectors, I maintain a curious and methodical mindset.`,
